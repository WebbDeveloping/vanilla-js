I spent 26 weeks, 9-5, 5 days a week going to a coding bootcamp, and I got fired: Was a coding bootcamp worth it?

The coding bootcamp route was a spontanious decision I made when learning how to code. A coding bootcamp can be expensive though, ranging from $5000, $10,000 and even as much as $20,000 for a 6-12 month training.

... But are coding bootcamps worth the money?
